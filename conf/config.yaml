  # Minimum number of thread to keep alive.

  # The type of connector to use. Other valid values are "nonblocking" or "legacy". In general, the
  # blocking connector should be used for low-latency services with short request durations. The
  # nonblocking connector should be used for services with long request durations or which
  # specifically take advantage of Jetty's continuation support.
  # If you need SSL support, you can either choose from "nonblocking+ssl" or "legacy+ssl".
  connectorType: blocking

  # The maximum amount of time a connection is allowed to be idle before being closed.

  # The number of threads dedicated to accepting connections. If omitted, this defaults to the
  # number of logical CPUs on the current machine.

  # The offset of the acceptor threads' priorities. Can be [-5...5], with -5 dropping the acceptor
  # threads to the lowest possible priority and with 5 raising them to the highest priority.

  # set to -1 or omitted, the system default is used.
